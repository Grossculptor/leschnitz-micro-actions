    "description": "Tonight, slip into the damp evening air near the two-kilometre park. Smell the wet leaves where ducal stories once bloomed. Paint 1945 dates in honey on forgotten benches - sweet, slow, visible only to ants and grandmothers who remember. Return every dusk for a week while the town sleeps, listening for the absent heartbeat of a capital erased by smiling tourism brochures. Document what the park's silence refuses to celebrate.",

    "description": "Walk along the old river path in Leschnitz where willows once whispered. Place small clay bowls filled with water from the Oder at three vanished tree sites. Each bowl holds a single floating seed marked with invisible ink: 'This was breathing.' After sunset, the Expansionist's new lights will erase their shadows, but morning dew will reveal the hidden words to children who still remember the taste of willow bark.",

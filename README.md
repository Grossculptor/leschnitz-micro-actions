# Leschnitz Micro Actions

An artistic research project exploring the transformation of local civic data into micro-artistic interventions. This system creates a continuous stream of poetic data sculptures derived from the cultural and administrative landscape of a specific European region, employing automated processes to reinterpret public information through an artistic lens. The work examines themes of post-war identity, linguistic heritage, and the aesthetics of bureaucratic communication in contemporary digital culture.
